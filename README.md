# AO-WeatherApp
## Overview

An accelerometer is a device that allows you to measure and analyse linear and angular acceleration ( the rate of change of an object’s velocity ) and takes measurements in one, two or three planes, this function is essential for many devices and systems whether it's to detect if a system is falling to detect seismic activity or to flip your phone to snooze \
There are two types of acceleration forces:

- Static forces are forces that are constantly being applied to the object (such as friction or gravity).
- Dynamic forces are “moving” forces applied to the object at various rates (such as vibration, or the force exerted on a ball).

\
In this project we build a fall-detection systems, that we can use in our smart phone to resolve the problem of falls among the elderly.
\
Technologies used :

- ReactJs
- Sass
- Web APIs
- Recharts
